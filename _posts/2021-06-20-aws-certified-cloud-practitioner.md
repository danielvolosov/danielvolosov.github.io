title: 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner 2021'
---

This past week was more productive than recent ones in memory. I had the opportunity to meet my colleagues in the office, set up some new furniture at home and get some good reading done. In addition - I decided to begin studying for my first AWS exam, the 'AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner'. 

I've worked on several projects where I have had the chance to use Microsoft Azure, however my current project primarily uses AWS and I knew that I wanted to contribute as much as possible. As someone who has implemented cloud solutions in the past, I knew that AWS wouldn't be a big change from what I was used to. I have already been hands-on with the platform for some time, but I knew that by preparing for the certification with a guided learning program - I would be able to pick up theory and awareness of existing services that I might not have the chance to use immediately.

I purchased a month of ACG to help me with my preparation - primarily because I appreciate the sandbox environments. I get a little nervous about the idea of forgetting to deprovision a resource and ending up with a large bill so I felt the bit of extra money was worth the peace of mind. So far it has been a good source of information and I find that the instructors have great energy. I have always felt that it's easier to learn new material from those that are passionate about what they teach and this is exactly what I have experienced so far while using this learning platform.

My goal for this upcoming week is to dedicate between 1.5 to 2 hours per night watching instructional videos and doing the labs. By my estimate, I should complete the course by the end of the week and be ready to take a practice exam. Depending on the result, I'll either need to review more material or I'll be ready to schedule the actual exam.

I am looking forward to tomorrow and excited to learn more.
