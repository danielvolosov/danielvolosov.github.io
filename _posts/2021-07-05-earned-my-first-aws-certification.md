title: 'Earned My First AWS Certification Today'
---

It has been a couple weeks since my last developer diary update. I have spent the majority of my time setting up my office space, gaining more knowledge in data engineering so that I may continue to contribute at work, and studying for my first AWS exam as I mentioned in my previous post. I spent some time wandering the city of Chicago this past Independence Day weekend (20,000 steps yesterday according to my Apple Watch!), however I decided to invest the remaining hours spent at home into AWS exam preparation through videos and hands-on labs.

I can thankfully say that I took my first cloud certification exam this afternoon and passed it. I'm thankful to God for being given the opportunity to study, learn and continue to chase my goals. My cloud computing knowledge has grown tremendously and that has motivated me to immediately begin preparing for my next AWS certification. I'm not entirely certain which exam path I'll be pursuing, but I have a pretty good idea. Enough to start at least.

I've also continued to educate myself on Lightbend technologies in my remaining time (When I'm not taking a break and playing Nintendo Switch or reading my Kindle). Every time I try to write a new algorithm for Subtle Algorithm and record it, I end up getting distracted and then going back to my exam preparation. The project is still a big priority, but free time is a little scarce at the moment. Based on my analytics - I see that despite several videos recorded for the blog earlier this year - my subscriptions have grown by only by one or two. I know that programming algorithms are likely a niche video topic, but I'd like to educate myself on how to potentially reach a larger audience.

In the meantime - my focus is set and I look forward to providing another update very soon.

Signing off - Daniel.
