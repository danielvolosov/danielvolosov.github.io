title: 'The End of Subtle Algorithm'
---

For a couple of years - I held on to an idea of creating instructional content for programmers or aspiring programmers. I made this idea a reality earlier this year in the form of a website called Subtle Algorithm. Initially - I had no idea where to start, but I knew that I wanted to create videos and written content to accommodate different learning styles. I wrote a few blogs and made several videos for my website.

Six months later - I've made the decision to end Subtle Algorithm altogether. While I invested a lot of time into the project, it wasn't all for nothing. I had the chance to figure out what I enjoy and some things that I don't. For example, despite my Bachelor of Business Administration degree in marketing - I don't enjoy social media or marketing. My content was very niche, and trying to drive traffic to my site was a challenge. It was an oversaturated content segment with plenty of resources doing the same thing. I wasn't bringing anything new into the picture. I was able to see through my analytics that the time invested in creating new content simply was not worth the return of the handful of viewers or readers.

If you love what you do, you'll do it regardless if people watch or not. After some time I learned that I was not enjoying what I was doing. I love my career and improving my craft, but recording and uploading videos while also trying to blog when possible just wasn't sustainable for me. The opportunity cost of having more time to solve more problems over creating graphics, recording videos and thinking about how to make it all available for more viewers was too high.

I still love to write, and I'll continue to do so through personal blog. But that's all it is - a personal blog that is focused on my own opinions, experiences and thoughts. It also allows me to direct more of my creative energy towards my full-time job, as I feel that I'll be able to have a much larger impact while focusing on what I do best.

I may continue to record the occassional algorithm video, but as of right now I don't think it will be very frequent. More of an occassional effort for me.

Thank you to anyone who read my old blogs and supported my videos. It was incredibly encouraging. I am glad to have been able to try something new and learn more about what I enjoy.

Signing off - Daniel.
